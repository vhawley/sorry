This game is a remake of the popular board game Sorry! You can play with 2-4 players.  The board on-screen is a 16x16 grid, with generic tiles bordering the grid, and safe tiles/home area lying inside the borders. Each player starts with 4 pawns in the Start zone, and can move these pawns based on the card they draw from the deck. The deck has 45 cards with 10 different types of cards. Some tiles allow you to "slide." If you land exactly on the beginning of a slide tile with a different color than yours, you can move to the end of the slide.  (this was not implemented).  The goal of the game is to get all 4 of your pawns into your color's home area.  If you're three spaces away from home but you draw a 5, you have to turn around 1 space from home and move in reverse.  When you reach the beginning of the safe zone going backwards, you can turn around again to face home.  

How to Play

1. When it is your turn, press “Draw card” to draw a card.
2. If the card you picked allows you to move a pawn, click on a pawn to manipulate it according to the card you drew.
